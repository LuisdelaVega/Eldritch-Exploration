Pitch Void is a randomly generated 2D shooter inspired by games like Hotline Miami, Enter the Gungeon, The Binding of Isaac and other games we love.

This is our very first game. It was made by my brother and I to familiarize ourselves with Unity and game development, but mostly to make and finish a fun project together.
